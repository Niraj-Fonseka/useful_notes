Reason : Didn't want to keep typing my Github username and password whenever im trying 
         to pull / push something from git in my raspberry pi. 
         
cd ~/.ssh/

* If there are any other rsa keys present move them into a different directory

* generate a new key

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@address.com"

* Give the file a name 

id_rsa

* When Propmpted to enter a paraprhase enter something you will remember 
( if you enter the pharaphase when you are doing a git command ie git pull, 
it will ask for the pharaphrase before completing the task.)

* Open the .pub file to get the public key 

cat id_rsa.pub

* copy the contents of the file. and create a new SSH key in the github under 'SSH an GPG keys'

* to test your connection 

ssh -T git@github.com
